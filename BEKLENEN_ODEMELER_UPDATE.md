# Beklenen Ã–demeler Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ **What We've Built**

I've successfully implemented the enhanced "Beklenen Ã–demeler" (Expected Payments) system with the new column structure and backend integration.

---

## ðŸ“Š **New Column Structure**

The page now displays the following columns as requested:

1. **MÃ¼ÅŸteri** - Customer name
2. **Ä°ÅŸlem Kodu** - Transaction code (from sales)
3. **AÃ§Ä±k Ã–deme** - Outstanding payment amount
4. **Ã–deme Tipi** - Payment type (Nakit/Kart)
5. **Taksit SayÄ±sÄ±** - Number of installments
6. **Taksit MiktarÄ±** - Installment amount
7. **Son Ã–deme** - Last payment date
8. **Ä°ÅŸlemler** - Actions (payment button for cash debts)

---

## ðŸ”§ **Backend Implementation**

### **Database Schema Updates:**
- Added `taksit_sayisi` and `taksit_miktari` columns to `beklenen_odemeler` table
- Automatic migration for existing databases

### **Smart Debt Detection:**
The new API automatically identifies debts from sales transactions:

```sql
-- Shows transactions with outstanding installments
-- Filters by 25-day rule for cash payments
-- Calculates remaining debt amounts
```

### **Key Features:**
1. **Automatic Debt Creation**: When "Ã¼rÃ¼n satÄ±ÅŸ" creates installment sales, debts appear automatically
2. **25-Day Rule**: Cash debts that haven't been paid for 25+ days are highlighted
3. **Card vs Cash Logic**: Only cash payments allow manual payment actions
4. **Real-time Updates**: Payments update cash flow and installment records

---

## ðŸŽ¨ **Frontend Updates**

### **Year Navigation Fix:**
- Removed year limitation in cash flow section
- Extended business metrics to show 10 future years (2025-2034)
- Users can now navigate to 2027+ without restrictions

### **Enhanced UI:**
- 8-column layout for comprehensive debt information
- Color-coded payment status (25+ days = red, 15+ days = orange, recent = green)
- Responsive design with proper spacing
- Real-time payment processing with user feedback

### **Payment Flow:**
1. User enters payment amount
2. System validates against installment amount
3. Marks next unpaid installment as paid
4. Updates cash flow automatically
5. Refreshes debt list to show updated status

---

## ðŸ”„ **Data Flow**

### **How Debts Are Created:**
```
ÃœrÃ¼n SatÄ±ÅŸ â†’ Installment Sale â†’ Payment Plan â†’ Taksit Detaylari â†’ Beklenen Ã–demeler
```

### **Payment Processing:**
```
User Payment â†’ Validate Amount â†’ Mark Installment Paid â†’ Update Cash Flow â†’ Refresh UI
```

### **Debt Filtering Logic:**
- Shows transactions with `taksit_miktar > 0`
- Includes unpaid installments
- Highlights cash debts overdue by 25+ days
- Excludes fully paid debts

---

## ðŸš€ **Key Benefits**

1. **Automatic Integration**: Debts appear automatically from sales
2. **Smart Filtering**: Only shows relevant outstanding debts
3. **Payment Tracking**: Real-time installment payment processing
4. **Cash Flow Integration**: Payments automatically update financial records
5. **Overdue Detection**: 25-day rule highlights problematic debts
6. **User-Friendly**: Clear visual indicators and intuitive actions
